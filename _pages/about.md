I'm an incoming first-year PhD student at University College London (UCL) working on Statistical Machine Learning and part of the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/) group. I'm co-funded by the Alan Turing Institute's foundational AI program, the Centre for Doctoral Training in Data-Intensive Science, and the Statistical Science department of UCL. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I was part of the Financial Engineering & Modelling team at Deloitte and also worked in the Global Equity Derivatives team at National Bank Financial. I completed a Master's degree in Statistics at the University of British Columbia and graduated from the Joint Honours in Mathematics and Physics program at McGill University for my undegraduate studies.
